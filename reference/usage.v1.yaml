    This is an API provided by the Learning Application in the SEM ecosystem, and is designed to enable a learning application to make information about usage of a product by a teacher or student to be confirmed to the Marketplace

    # Events

    It is envisaged that the service implementing this API, also implements the generic [Events](https://stichtingsem.stoplight.io/docs/sem-technology-prototype/reference/events.v1.yaml) and [Webhooks](https://stichtingsem.stoplight.io/docs/sem-technology-prototype/reference/webhooks.v1.yaml) API to enable subscription to changes vs polling.


    Events generated by the Usage API are connected to (first) use of the product.
     - `la.usage.first` - First time
     - `la.usage.ongoing` - Regular usage
