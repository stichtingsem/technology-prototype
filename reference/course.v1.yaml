  title: 'Stream, Progress & Results API'
  version: '1.0'
  description: |-
    This API enables a learning application to provide information about the specific activities available within the application that can be scheduled within an LMS.  This data is always exchanged in the context of a school, as not only can information vary by school (e.g. a learning application may allow material to be modified or configured specific to the needs of that organisation), but this API enables the sharing of progress and results - which is sensitive data and as such we must ensure that it is only shared after approval by the school to exchange this information between the LA and the LMS.

    ### Event Access

    |Events|Event Data|Rationale|
    |------|---------|
    |la.result| // as per XAPI statements |To enable the LMS to receive XAPI statements after registering webhook for a specific school|
    |la.stream| // as per Course |To enable the LMS to receive updates to course information for a specific school|
