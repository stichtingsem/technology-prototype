  title: Marketplace Entitlement API
  version: '1.0'
  description: |
    This is an API provided by the Marketplace in the SEM ecosystem, and is designed to enable a marketplace to make information about products that have been selected or purchased by a school or individual to be then added automatically into the LMS of the school, as well as be used by the specific Learning Application that has been purchased to ensure that all setup and provisioning has been completed in advance of access.

    It is envisaged that the service implementing this API, also implements the generic [Events](https://stichtingsem.stoplight.io/docs/sem-technology-prototype/reference/events.v1.yaml) and [Webhooks](https://stichtingsem.stoplight.io/docs/sem-technology-prototype/reference/webhooks.v1.yaml) API to enable subscription to changes vs polling.

    Events generated by the Entitlement API are connected to state changes.

     - `mp.entitlement.active` - First created and active
     - `mp.entitlement.refunded` - Refunded
     - `mp.entitlement.updated` - Modified in any other way

        Get all entitlements related to products from a specific provider of a learning application (or other product used by a school).  It is assumed that at the point of setup and provision of an API key, that the provider name is also stored against the API key by the marketplace, so that all calls with this key will be filtered to that specific provider in the response.

        This API has pagination, using `start` and `limit`, with an optional `status` filter.
